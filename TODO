symlinks
--------

Currently, we skip them .. need to find a way to compare them. Following the
links is not an option since that fails if the link is dead (target doesn't
exist anymore). In that case, we still want to be able to compare dirs which
have links. One option would be to treat them as a file with a one-line content
which is the link target's name or a combination of link name and target name
in a string which we can bash, such as

    link -> target

which should be fairly unique. At least that's one deterministic way to treat
links.

post-processing and caching
---------------------------
By default pickle and save results and re-use them if no command line args are
given. Add various text output options covering the stuff done with shell tools
in the README for now. For playing with output modes, we need cached results
(speed). But first, gather useful output modes by using the code on large file
collections before implementing stuff.
