symlinks
--------
Currently, we skip them .. need to find a way to compare them. Following the
links is not an option since that fails if the link is dead (target doesn't
exist anymore). In that case, we still want to be able to compare dirs which
have links. One option would be to treat them as a file with a one-line content
which is the link target's name or a combination of link name and target name
in a string which we can hash, such as

    link -> target

which should be fairly unique. At least that's one deterministic way to treat
links.

stdout/stderr
-------------
Use logging module.

imports
-------
Use package-local relative imports

leaf fingerprints (fpr): use file size as well
----------------------------------------------
Use file size as well as content hash. Or do it iteratively (like some other
tools):
1) fpr = hash(file size)
2) for remaining equals: fpr = hash(file or part of file, depening on --limit)
3) Maybe only useful to incorporate into auto-limit iteration?
